# Classless Inter-Domain Routing

Classless Inter-Domain Routing, or CIDR for short, refers to the IP address
notation such as this:

```
192.168.0.0/23
```

The `/23` on the end refers to the number of bits in the IP address that refer
to network (with the remaining bits referring to the host within the network).
